# Suicide Bombing Attacks in Pakistan – EDA

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on suicide bombing attacks in Pakistan, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights from the data along with highlighting socio-political and demographic factors associated with these incidents.

## Objectives
- Analyze fatalities (min/max) by year, city, and temperature
- Examine correlations between environmental factors and impact
- Identify the most affected regions and time periods
- Support data-driven insights for policy and peace efforts

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values (mean, median, grouped means)
- Feature Engineering (datetime parsing, extraction)
- Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Correlation & Trend Analysis
- Distribution & Time Series Analysis

## Sample Visualizations
- Year-wise fatalities (line graph of Killed Min & Max)
- Top 10 deadliest cities (bar chart with hue)
- Distribution of number of suicide blasts
- Regression plot of Temperature vs Fatalities
- Explosive Weight distribution and impact

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Dataset
The dataset includes incident-wise records of suicide bombing attacks in Pakistan, including:
- Date, Year, City, Province
- Number of Suicide Blasts
- Fatalities (Min/Max)
- Explosive Weight
- Temperature (°C)
- and more...

## Key Findings
- Some cities have disproportionately high fatalities
- No strong linear correlation between temperature and fatalities
- Trends over time indicate regional shifts in impact

## How to Run
- Clone this repo
- Install required libraries
- Run the notebook or script in Jupyter or any Python environment
- View visualizations and insights

## Output
Visualizations and insights that can help security analysts, policymakers, and researchers understand:
- Where and when suicide bombings occur most frequently
- Which provinces and cities suffer the highest fatalities and injuries
- Trends over the years to monitor escalation or decline
- Impact factors like temperature, holidays, and public gatherings
- How to optimize security measures based on historical and regional patterns
